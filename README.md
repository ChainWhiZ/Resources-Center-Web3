GM folks,

The main gial is to create a one stop place for all respurces (at least thats the aim).

To contribute, here are the guidelines:

1. Creat an issue with the topic you want to cover.
2. Clone this Repo,  create a file with the name of the topic you want to cover.
3. Create a branch in the format <issue_number>-<branch_name>.
4. Tag anyone of the member from Chainwhiz for review.
